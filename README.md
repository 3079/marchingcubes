# Marching Cubes
This personal project is my take at implementing the marching cubes algorithm with various types of underlying map generators (currently 3d cellular automata and layered noise sampling). 
My main goals are to achieve good performance and generate somewhat realistic looking cave systems with the ability to terraform, kinda like the one seen in Deep Rock Galactic
